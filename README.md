# swerve
Library for Swerve Math and Utilities.

# Notable Files

- conversion - All the conversion VIs we use (our units are in ft/s and degrees for the pod setpoints which get converted to raw motor units)
- ctl - All of the typedefs we use to standardize the data
- hardware - All of our hardware utilities used for a robot project implementation (see swerve-template for an example)
- math - Contains the lower level math for inverse kinematics, pod optimizations, field centric, and forward kinematics
- test - Test code and simulations to test and demo the library's functions. See [Inverse Kinematics Test](https://github.com/frc2468/swerve/blob/main/test/Inverse%20Kinematics%20Test/Inverse%20Kinematics%20Test.vi)
